On assumptions
the assumption would parse the text with one of the random (unused) clauses 
then validate the claim, that the text is either a question or a statement
the number of iterations is determined by the weight algorithm per clause versus the weight of the thought
the result would then fall into either array (of assumptions that it is or is not a question)
when the clauses are finished, or the iterations are determined, the algorithm will parse the results for both arrays
then create a new thought pattern for answering
The new thought will generate recursive q/a thoughts, determined on the weight
